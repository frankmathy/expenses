# Expenses - iOS Expense Management App
The Expenses App is an iOS App Developed in Swift for managing your daily expenses. I've tried many of the apps available on the AppStore, but they fail by having complex user interfaces, non-intuitive / non-iOS-standard controls, missing multi user support and more.
This app is currently in development and objectives in its implementation have been:
- Simplistic user interface using standard iOS List View controls etc.
- Cloud support for sharing accounts with other users (implemented using Apple's CloudKit)
- Live updates for new expenses
- Simple reporting controls
- Export / import funcationality
The application is only intended for tracking your daily expenses (cash money), it's not ment to be a financial software to track your bank accounts etc..
